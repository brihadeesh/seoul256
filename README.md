# Dotfiles

## Background
These were made as part of an experiment to use a light theme called
[seoul256](https://github.com/junegunn/seoul256.vim). I currently use a different set of
applications for things:

* **WM**: bspwm currently but I've included herbstluftwm configs as well
* **Menu**: dmenu
* **Terminal**: st although I also use termite 
* **Editor**: Emacs and occasionally nano; I was a neovimmer for a while but have not used it in a
  while. Hopefully I'll be switching to using the [Nvim-R](https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R)
  plugin for R
* **Music**: mpd + ncmpcpp (configs not included)

## Installing
You'll need to install whatever software I use: I'll include a comprehensive list later on but it's
not too hard to figure out from just examining the files. You'll find that
[`stow`](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) is perhaps the most convenient tool to use these
files.
